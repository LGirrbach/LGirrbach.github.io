The drama of this song is due to its switching from an outside perspective to an inside perspective within the song.
In the beginning, we see how the female lyrical self is perceived from the "outside", meaning from a neutral perspective.
She is not particularly interesting, in short, it's not worth hanging out with her.

<p class="interpretation">
Then, we see a dramatic change: The "you" is suddenly coming close, and the result is a loss of control of the situation.
At this point the perspective is shifted to the "inside", meaning the subjective perception of the female lyrical self by the "you".
Here, she is far from a boring person, and even capable of melting the "you" by her charms.
</p>
<p class="interpretation">
Another interesting twist is how control is characterised.
In the beginning, the lyrical self is characterised is helpless and more or less delivered to the expectations and judgements of her peers.
During the dramatic meeting with the "you", it is even suggested that the protagonist entirely loses control of the situation, and is not even able to make conversation.
However, once in the inside perspective, the workings of her charms are revealed as far from uncontrolled.
This is a particularity of the inside perspective, because what appears unplanned or even the result of insufficient taste or preparation, suddenly becomes a well-planned trap.

<p class="interpretation">
In conclusion, we see that even basic features such as intent and of course beauty are purely in the eye of the beholder, and the subjective perspective imposes very different and mutually incompatible interpretations on the same observations.
