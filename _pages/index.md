_Hello, I am Leander, currently a PhD researcher in the <a href="https://www.eml-unitue.de/"> Explainable Machine Learning Group</a> at the University of Tübingen.
I earned my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics from the University of Tübingen and my Bachelor's degree, also in Computational Linguistics, from the University of Heidelberg._
<br/><br/>
_My primary academic interest centers around gaining a better understanding of deep learning -- understanding how neural networks work and constructing models that are more interpretable._
<br/><br/>
_Beyond academia, I am fascinated by ancient cultures and languages, with a special focus on traditional Japanese culture. Two of my favourite hobbies include enjoying tea and engaging with Japanese poetry. Also, I like hand-writing and paper, especially Origami paper, and I participate in <a href="https://www.postcrossing.com/"> Postcrossing</a>, a postcard exchange project._
